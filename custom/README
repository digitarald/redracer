Customization
=============
This folder can be used to customize behavior of the application without fiddling with the application itself.

config/
-------
Custom config files go here. Currently, there is only "settings.xml".

layout/
-------
Custom templates go here. The structure is identical to that of the main application. Use this to override the default templates.

Examples:
- custom/layout/templates/Master.php to override the general layout.
- custom/layout/modules/Account/Templates/LoginSuccess.php to override the "Login Successful" page.
