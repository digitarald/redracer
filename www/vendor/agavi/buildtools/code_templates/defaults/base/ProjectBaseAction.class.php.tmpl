<?php

class ProjectBaseAction extends AgaviAction
{
	/*
		This is the base action all your application's actions should extend.
		This way, you can easily inject new functionality into all of your actions.
		
		One example would be to extend the initialize() method and assign commonly
		used objects such as the request as protected class members.
		
		Another example would be a custom isSimple() method that returns true if the
		current container has the "is_slot" parameter set - that way, all actions
		run as a slot would automatically be switched to "simple" mode.
		
		Even if you don't need any of the above and this class remains empty, it is
		strongly recommended you keep it. There shall come the day where you are
		happy to have it this way ;)
